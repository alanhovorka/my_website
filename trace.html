			<h3>Buffalo Trace a trail of mystery, movement</h3>

			<p><i>Republished with permission from The Dubois County Herald.</i></p>

			<p>By ALAN HOVORKA</p>

			<p>In an effort to preserve a unique piece of Hoosier history, a group of dedicated volunteers searched out and documented the approximate, sometimes exact, locations of the first major road used by settlers into Indiana &mdash; just in time for the state&rsquo;s 200th birthday.</p>

			<p>The Buffalo Trace Working Group, formed in fall 2014, spent about a year and a half combing through survey records, journals, satellite imagery and other documents in order to find the closest approximations of where the Buffalo Trace was. The group members then set out across Southern Indiana to document, with GPS technology, the remains of the old buffalo trail used by Native Americans and white settlers, which was the first major roadway from Vincennes to the Falls of the Ohio River.</p>

			<p>The Buffalo Trace is a trail carved by the migration of hordes of bison (called American buffalo) through countless years. The path went by a number of names during the 1800s, such as the Vincennes Road or Harrison&rsquo;s Road, and was part of larger buffalo migratory route that ran through Indiana, Illinois and Kentucky. It served as the first major road into what became Indiana.</p>

			<p>What makes the Buffalo Trace Working Group&rsquo;s findings significant is that this is the closest anyone has ever been to knowing the location of the routes the trace covered since it was more or less lost after 1825. They either found the exact locations of the trace or were within a couple hundred feet. What&rsquo;s more is the findings will be public domain once they&rsquo;re published. The group hopes to have all of their work wrapped up by the end of the year, in time for Indiana&rsquo;s Bicentennial.</p>

			<p>Many families settling in Dubois and the surrounding counties came into the territory via the Buffalo Trace. It remains a significant part of family history for people like David Drake, coordinator and team leader for field work for the Buffalo Trace Working Group in Dubois and Orange county. Drake&rsquo;s reports are now available at the Dubois County Museum.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;My family settled along the Orange-Dubois county line,&rdquo; said Drake, a 64-year-old Huntingburg resident. &ldquo;And, as I worked through my family history, I was trying to figure out where they came through. They came in the early 1800s.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>He started digging for answers as to how his family arrived in the state, which led him to research the Buffalo Trace and the work of Angela Doyle, heritage resource specialist and travel liaison for the U.S. Forest Service at the Hoosier National Forest.</p>

			<p>Doyle and her colleagues in Bedford chipped away at finding the exact locations and crossings of the trace in the Hoosier National Forest for two decades. She wrote an article on the progress she and her colleagues had made in 2014 that garnered the attention of not only Drake, but of about 25 others.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;I realized that I had the opportunity to organize a group of people into volunteers to do the work that I, as a federal servant, had been unable to really do well as part of my regular duties,&rdquo; Doyle said.</p>

			<p>Doyle and a group of volunteers formed the Buffalo Trace Working Group with the goal of researching, locating and preserving the locations of the Buffalo Trace in southern Indiana using survey records from 1805 to 1807.</p>

			<p>They used GPS units to plot the location of the remnants of the trace while they were out in the field. This is the first time a permanent, extensive record of this nature has been created about the trace, even if some of the locations are still approximations or best guesses.</p>

			<p>The group formed committees responsible for tracking down various parts of the trail and then set out on researching their locations.</p>

			<p>The trace&rsquo;s general path in Indiana, traveling west toward Illinois, begins at the Falls of the Ohio River near New Albany and continues toward the Wabash River by Vincennes before crossing into Illinois. This road, often 12 to 20 feet wide in places, was the most direct route to Vincennes in the 1800s, which was the main destination in the territory at that time. It crossed (east to west) Floyd, Harrison, Orange, Dubois, Pike and Knox counties for the most part.</p>

			<p>The trace wasn&rsquo;t a typical road because it was carved out by the buffalo. It had a number of small side paths and curves. It did have a clear, main path, which was the path from the Falls to Vincennes. The buffalo wandered and didn&rsquo;t always use the same pathway to reach their destination for a number of reasons, such as weather.</p>

			<p>The working group focused on the primary route, however. Many of the side paths &mdash; and even some of the main paths &mdash; have been lost to time. Drake found a lot of the trace in eastern Dubois County, but did not have as much success in the western part of the county because of farmers.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Any remnants of the trace are just going to be long gone because the farmers have eliminated it. Or if it&rsquo;s been through a town,&rdquo; said Drake, who assisted in the Knox County field work of the project. &ldquo;Primarily, I was looking for wooded tracks, where I could find the property owner and ask for permission to go out there and see if I could see anything.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>This wasn&rsquo;t the first attempt to locate the historic pathway. The trace was more or less lost by 1825 because of population explosion between 1800 and 1830, before and after Indiana became a state in 1816.</p>

			<p>In 1800, there were about 2,600 people living in Indiana, according to U.S. Census data. By 1810, the number of people in the state grew to 24,000, reaching 147,000 in 1820 and 343,000 in 1830.</p>

			<p>The old buffalo trail was a critical route for settlers, supplies and militia during Indiana&rsquo;s early days, Drake noted. As the state expanded, so did the road and the need for new roads. Side trails and alternate routes sprouted up everywhere.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;After we became a state, people were coming into the territory so fast, roads were being built everywhere,&rdquo; he said. Settlers needed a way to their cabins and would make their own roads.</p>

			<p>An example of this is what&rsquo;s now known as the Paoli Pike. It was built from Paoli to New Albany, separate from the Buffalo Trace because the land was flatter.</p>

			<p>The pursuit of progress drove the trace out of the minds of people, Drake said.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t care about that old Buffalo Trace anymore &mdash; we&rsquo;ve got to get to the county seat,&rdquo; he said about the mindset at the time. &ldquo;We could not care less about that old stupid road, you know? So nobody cared about it anymore. It was all progress and new county developments and it was just forgotten.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>In 1935, state leaders decided it was time to remember. A three-person commission was created to find the location of the trace and to test the viability of incorporating it into the state highway system. George R. Wilson, a Dubois County historian, led the commission.</p>

			<p>The commission&rsquo;s 1936 report found that most of the road was gone and it wouldn&rsquo;t be feasible to turn it into a state road.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s likely no one will ever know the 100 percent accurate location of the trace, Doyle said. Several parts of the trace are just gone.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s going to ever be a route that people can walk or drive from beginning to end,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There are just a lot of segments that just don&rsquo;t exist. They&rsquo;ve been plowed under or are under an existing road or we didn&rsquo;t get landowner permission to walk that 40-acre parcel.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Besides publishing reports on the location of the trace in various counties, which will be delivered to libraries in Dubois and other counties, the group has put together a website in partnership with Indiana University Southeast to share the findings with the public</p>

			<p>One committee of the working group received a grant from Indiana Humanities to put together 70 educational boxes for fourth-grade classrooms in southern Indiana. The boxes include hands-on material, such as bison teeth, surveyor&rsquo;s notes, surveyor&rsquo;s chain or a fragment of a rifle barrel, that represent Indiana history and 15 lesson plans; they&rsquo;re being distributed this summer for use in the upcoming school year.</p>

			<p>Another product currently being produced is an ArcGIS Story Map that will use the GPS data collected by field surveyors to create an interactive map that details the history of the trace and its role in Indiana history.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a little Indiana gem,&rdquo; Doyle said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just one more thing for us to bring about that we have this and that we&rsquo;re trying to learn about it and here, see what we&rsquo;ve found so far.&rdquo;</p>
